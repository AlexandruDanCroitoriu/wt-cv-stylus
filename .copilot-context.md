## Project Operations Philosophy

**ALL PROJECT OPERATIONS SHOULD BE DONE VIA SCRIPTS**

This project follows a script-driven development approach where all common operations (building, running, testing, deployment) are handled through standardized scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

### Script-Based Development
- **Build Operations**: Use `./scripts/build.sh [--debug|--release] [clean]` for unified build management
- **Running Application**: Use `./scripts/run.sh [--debug|--release]` with auto-build and port conflict resolution
- **Library Management**: Use `./scripts/clone_libraries.sh` for external dependency management
- **Memory Analysis**: Use `./scripts/memory_analyzer.sh` for single-shot comprehensive memory analysis
- **Memory Monitoring**: Use `./scripts/memory_monitor.sh [-i interval]` for real-time memory monitoring
- **Help and Reference**: Use `./scripts/README.sh` for colorized script overview and usage examples


### Scripts Development Context
For comprehensive script development guidelines, templates, and standards:
**📁 [Scripts Development Context](scripts/.copilot-context.md)**

This includes:
- Complete script inventory with descriptions
- Mandatory script structure templates
- Script integration patterns and best practices
- Color coding and logging standards
- Error handling requirements


> **Note:**  
> All project operations must be performed using the provided scripts.  
> If you need to create a new script, please initiate a discussion first to ensure alignment with project standards and avoid duplication.


This context helps Copilot understand the project structure and coding standards when generating new scripts or code.
