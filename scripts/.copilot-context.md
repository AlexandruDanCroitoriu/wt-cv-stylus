## Quick Reference

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Standard development cycle
./scripts/build.sh --debug        # Build in debug mode
./scripts/run.sh --debug          # Run with auto-rebuild if needed

# Production workflow
./scripts/build.sh --release      # Build optimized version
./scripts/run.sh --release        # Run production build

# Docker workflow
./scripts/docker-b-wt-cv-stylus.sh    # Build production image
./scripts/docker-r-wt-cv-stylus.sh    # Run containerized app
```

### Common Operations
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./scripts/build.sh --debug clean

# Memory monitoring during development
./scripts/memory_monitor.sh <PID>

# Setup dependencies (Ubuntu)
./scripts/ubuntu-install-dependencies.sh

# Get help for any script
./scripts/script-name.sh --help
```

### Log Files
All scripts log their output to `scripts/output/`:
- `build.log` - Build operations
