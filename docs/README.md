## How GitHub Copilot Uses These Files

All documentation files are configured in `.vscode/settings.json` to provide context to GitHub Copilot:

```json
{
    "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions.files": [
        "docs/development_guide.md",
        "docs/project-overview.md", 
        "docs/component-reference.md",
        "docs/api-reference.md",
        "docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md",
        "docs/build-deployment.md",
        "docs/GETTING_STARTED.md"
    ]
}
```

This enables GitHub Copilot to:
- Understand the project architecture and patterns
- Suggest code that follows the established conventions
- Provide contextually relevant assistance for WT framework development
- Reference the correct APIs and patterns for each component

## Quick Navigation

## Updating Documentation

When making significant changes to the codebase:

1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Ensure examples and code snippets are current
3. Update the API reference if interfaces change
4. Test that GitHub Copilot suggestions align with documented patterns

This documentation structure ensures that both developers and AI assistants have comprehensive, up-to-date information about the WT CV Stylus project.
